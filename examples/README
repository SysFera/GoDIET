Examples:

commented.xml: this file is not meant to be executed as an example.  It
              explains what elements you need in an input XML file for 
              GoDIET.

example1.xml: this example provides a very simple DIET run executed
              with GoDIET on the localhost.  This example leaves as
              much as possible to automatic configuration (making
              the XML as short as possible).  The example launches
              omniNames, 1 MA, 1 LA, and 1 SeD.

example2.xml: this is a working example tested on VTHD.  It includes
              omniNames, LogCentral, and testTool on the machine ls2,
              An MA and LA on the cristal cluster, 2 LAs on the LS 
              cluster, and numerous SeDs on both clusters of type
              dmat_manips or scalar.  Note that VTHD lacks a DNS,
              thus the compute description for every machine includes 
              an end point contact containing the IP address of the
              machine.
