\chapter{Deploying a \diet platform}
\label{ch:deploying}

Deployment is the process of launching a \diet platform including agents and
servers.  For \diet, this process includes writing configuration files for each
element and launching the elements in the correct hierarchical order. There are
three primary ways to deploy \diet.

Launching \textbf{by hand} is a reasonable way to deploy \diet for small-scale
testing and verification. This chapter explains the  necessary services, how to
write \diet configuration files, and in what order \diet elements should be
launched.  See Section~\ref{sec:deployBasics} for details.

\textbf{\godiet} is a Java-based tool for automatic \diet deployment that
manages configuration file creation, staging of files, launch of elements,
monitoring and reporting on launch success, and process cleanup when the \diet
deployment is no longer needed.   See  Section~\ref{sec:deployGoDIET} for
details.

\textbf{Writing your own scripts} is a surprisingly popular approach.  This
approach often looks easy initially, but can sometimes take much, much longer
than you predict as there are many complexities to manage.  Learn \godiet -- it
will save you time!

\label{sec:deployGoDIET}
%Quickstart
%%Description
\godiet is an cross-platform tool that helps you automate ad-hoc deployment and
management procedures for \diet infrastructure. It manages
configuration file creation, staging of files, launch of elements, monitoring
and reporting.  \godiet is extremely useful for large deployments on a complex
physical infrastructure. The mains features are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Complete command line interface.
  \item Distributed command execution via SSH.
  \item Real time monitoring applications state.
  \item Complex physical infrastructure management with firewall and multiple
    network lan.
\end{itemize}

  \caption{Design principle of \godiet.\label{fig:GODIETDesign}}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Quickstart}
For hurry people.

\subsubsection{Installing GoDiet}

The following operating systems are known to support GoDiet:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Linux: Most recent distributions are likely to work
    \item Mac OS X 10.4 or later
\end{itemize}

You need to have the Sun Java 6 or openJDK6 installed. All operating system with Java 6 must support 
First download \godiet on the project website\footnote{http://graal.ens-lyon.fr/DIET/godiet.html}.

 Extract the archive just and launch run.bat or run.sh script.
You need to load your physical platform on which will \godiet will
running. This platform must be describe in a XML file based on
\it{Platform.xsd} grammar. You can find an simple file in the example directory 



%%Platform Diet
The user of \godiet could describes the desired
deployment in an XML file including all needed external services (\eg omniNames
and LogService); the desired hierarchical organization of agents and servers is
expressed directly using the hierarchical organization of XML. 
%%Physical platform
The user also defines all machines available for the deployment, disk scratch
space available at each site for storage of configuration files, and which
machines share the same disk to avoid unecessary copies. 

%% Note that debugging deployment problems when using \godiet can
%% be difficult, especially if you don't fully understand the role of each element
%% you are launching. If you have trouble identifying the problem, read the rest
%% of this chapter in full and try launching key elements of your deployment by
%% hand.

An example input XML file is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:godietXml}; see
\cite{CDa05} for a full explanation of all entries in the XML. You can also
have a look at the fully commented XML example file provided in the \godiet
distribution under examples/commented.xml, each option is explained. To launch
\godiet for the simple example XML file provided in the \godiet distribution
under examples/example1.xml, run:

\begin{verbatim}
~ > java -jar GoDIET-x.x.x.jar example1.xml
XmlScanner constructor
Parsing xml file: example1.xml
GoDIET>
\end{verbatim}

\godiet reads the XML file and then enters an interactive console mode. In this
mode you have a number of options:

%% \begin{verbatim}
%% GoDIET> help
%% The following commands are available:
%%    launch:       launch entire DIET platform
%%    launch_check: launch entire DIET platform then check its status
%%    relaunch:     kill the current platform and launch entire DIET platform once again
%%    stop:         kill entire DIET platform using kill pid
%%    status:       print run status of each DIET component
%%    history:      print history of commands executed
%%    help:         print this message
%%    check:        check the platform status
%%    stop_check:   stop the platform status then check its status before exit
%%    exit:         exit GoDIET, do not change running platform.
%% \end{verbatim}

We will now launch this example; note that this example is intentionally very
simple with all components running locally to provide initial familiarity with
the \godiet run procedure. Deployment with \godiet is especially useful  when
launching components on multiple remote machines.

\begin{verbatim}
GoDIET> launch
* Launching DIET platform at Wed Jul 13 09:57:03 CEST 2005

Local scratch directory ready:
        /home/hdail/tmp/scratch_godiet

** Launching element OmniNames on localHost
Writing config file omniORB4.cfg
Staging file omniORB4.cfg to localDisk
Executing element OmniNames on resource localHost

** Launching element MA_0 on localHost

Waiting for 2 seconds after launch without log service feedback
* DIET launch done at Wed Jul 13 09:57:14 CEST 2005 [time= 11.0 sec]
\end{verbatim}

The \texttt{status} command will print out the run-time status of all launched
components. The \texttt{LaunchState} reports whether \godiet observed any
errors during the launch itself. When the user requests the launch of
LogService in the input XML file, \godiet can connect to the LogService  after
launching it to obtain the state of launched components; when available, this
state is reported in the \texttt{LogState} column.

\begin{verbatim}
GoDIET> status
Status   Element   LaunchState   LogState   Resource     PID
         OmniNames running       none       localHost    1232
         MA_0      running       none       localHost    1262
         LA_0      running       none       localHost    1296
         SeD_0     running       none       localHost    1329
\end{verbatim}

Finally, when you are done with your \diet deployment you should always run
\texttt{stop}. To clean-up each element, \godiet runs a \texttt{kill} operation
on the appropriate host using the stored PID of that element.

\begin{verbatim}
GoDIET> stop

* Stopping DIET platform at Wed Jul 13 10:05:42 CEST 2005
Trying to stop element SeD_0
Trying to stop element LA_0
Trying to stop element MA_0
Trying to stop element OmniNames

* DIET platform stopped at Wed Jul 13 10:05:43 CEST 2005[time= 0.0 sec]
* Exiting GoDIET. Bye.
\end{verbatim}

\begin{figure}[p]
\input{xml_example.tex}.
\caption{Example XML input file for \godiet.\label{fig:godietXml}}
\end{figure}

One of the main problem when writing a \godiet XML input file is to be compliant
with the dtd. A good tool to validate a \godiet file before using \godiet is
\textbf{xmllint}. This tool exist on most platforms and with the following
command:
\begin{verbatim}
$ xmllint your_xml_file --dtdvalid path_to_GoDIET.dtd -noout
\end{verbatim}
you will see the different lines where there is problem and a clear description
of why your XML file is not compliant.

\section{Shape of the hierarchy}

A recurrent question people ask when first using \diet, is \emph{how should my
  hierarchy look like?} There is unfortunately no universal answer to
this. The shape highly depends on the performances you want \diet to
attain. The performance metric that we often use to characterize the
performance of \diet is the \emph{throughput} the clients get, \ie the number
of serviced requests per time unit. 

Several heuristics have been proposed to determine the shape of the hierarchy
based on the users' requirements. We can distinguish two main studies. The
first one focused on deploying a single service in a \diet
hierarchy~\cite{InProceedingsCaron.CCD_08,InProceedingsCaron.CCL_04}. The shape
of the best hierarchy on a fully homogeneous platform is a \emph{Complete
Spanning d-ary tree} (CSD tree). The second study focused on deploying several
services alongside in a single hierarchy. Heuristics based on linear
programming and genetic algorithm have been proposed for different kinds of
platform~\cite{CARON:2010:INRIA-00490406:1,CARON:2010:INRIA-00456045:3}.

Even though the above mentioned studies can provide good, if not the best,
deployments, they heavily rely on modelizations and benchmarks of \diet and the
services. This process can be quite long. Thus, we propose in this section a
simple but somehow efficient way of deploying a hopefully ``good'' hierarchy.
(Note that if you do not care about performances, a simple star
graph should be enough, \ie an MA and all your \seds directly connected to it.)
Here are a few general remarks on \diet hierarchies:
\begin{itemize}
\item The more computations your service needs, the more powerful server you
  should choose to put a \sed on.
\item Scheduling performances of agents depends on the number of children they
  have, as well as on the number of services each of the child knows. An agent
  will be more efficient when all its children know one and the same
  service. Thus it is a good idea to group all \seds having the same
  characteristics under a common agent.
\item The services declared by an agent to its parent is the union of all
  services present in its underlying hierarchy.
\item It is usually a good idea to group all \diet elements having the same
  services and present on a given cluster under a common agent.
\item There is usually no need for too many levels of agents.
\item If you suspect that an agent does not schedule the requests fast enough,
  and that it is overloaded, then add two (or more) agents under this agent,
  and divide the previous children between these new agents.
