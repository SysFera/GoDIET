| GoDIET 2.4 |
+------------+
* Changes since 2.3:
	- uses jline for a more interactive command line interface:
	you can press the tab key to have command auto-completion
	- new commands have been added:
	  + launch_check: launch the platform and automatically checks its
	    availability
	  + relaunch: entirely kills the platform and relaunches it
	  + relaunch_failed: do not kill the platform, but try to relaunch 
	    all the elements that are currently unavailable. The DIET
	    elements will be automatically reconnected to their parents
	  + start_watcher/stop_watcher: starts or stops a watchdog which
	    periodically checks all the elements, and tries to relaunch the
	    unavailable elements.
	  + stop_check: stops the platform, and then checks that every
	    element has really been shut down.
* limitations:
	- currently GoDIET do not allow the deployment of DIET or
	LogService forwarders.
