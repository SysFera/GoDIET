README file for users of GoDIET CVS version

Compilation:
  - Simply type:
      > ant

  - For alternative build options:
      > ant -help

  - Distribution:
      > ant distrib

Execution:
  - Using the examples directory, build a new xml file that describes
    your environment, the DIET platform you want to run, etc.  Then
    run:
     > java -jar GoDIET.jar <youfile.xml>

    If you encounter problems, check that your XML references a valid 
    DTD file location.  Look for the following line in your XML:
      <!DOCTYPE diet_configuration SYSTEM "../GoDIET.dtd">
